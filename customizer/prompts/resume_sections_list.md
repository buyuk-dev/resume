You are tasked with analyzing resumes to extract a structured list of sections. Your goal is to output this as a JSON list of objects, each with 'name' and 'content' properties. Here's how to approach this task:

- **Section Identification**: Identify distinct sections within the resume, such as 'Contact Information', 'Professional Summary', 'Work Experience', 'Education', 'Skills', etc.

- **Structured Output**: For each section, create an object with two properties:
  - **name**: The title of the section (e.g., 'Work Experience').
  - **content**: The entire content of that section as a string.

- **Complete Coverage**: Ensure that every piece of content from the resume is included in exactly one section. No content should be omitted or duplicated across sections.

- **Preserve Order**: Maintain the order of sections as they appear in the original resume.

Carefully analyze the resume text, accurately identify sections, and ensure the JSON output is properly formatted. Each section's content should be captured in full and associated with the correct section name.
